# Stock Analysis Project

## Overview of Project: 
Working in a business analyst position will require looking at the same reports repetitively.  By writing VBA code we can automate the filtering of data and create programs that will help our teams analyze data.  

## Results 
On a quick glance we can see that 2017 was a much more successful year for the entire 'Green Stock' industry within this dataset.  The most successful stock year over year were "ENPH". "RUN" is the only other stock that was only other stock that was up in return both years, however, their return in 2017 was well behind the average of the dataset.  Their performance in 2018 gives us reason to investigate the company more and find out what may have caused their strong performance in 2018.

We began this project investigating "DQ" as an interesting stock.  They had the best performance of the entire set in 2017, but their return dropped to the lowest in the set in 2018. We recommend finding what may have caused this decrease in performance.  Their two year return is still strong, and their trading volume increased in 2018.  It may have been a good time to buy this stock if they forecasted a strong 2019(depending on when this analysis was actually performed). 

## Summary
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
There is a large advantage to utilize the refactoring of code.  While refactoring the code did require a few extra lines of coding, it saved time while running the code.  Prior to refactoring the code, the program would run in just under a second.  A program that was processing larger amounts of data would take more time and be less efficient.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
By improving the code through the refactoring process, we will save the end user of this program time.  If we were writing code for large teams of stock analysts or executives we would want to make our programs as user-friendly and require the least amount of time to run, read, and maximize the output data for anyone reading.
